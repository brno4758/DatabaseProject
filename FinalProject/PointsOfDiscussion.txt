Thought about 'positions' relation, but didnt make sense because not all members of one position would be paid the same.

Could have 'Dues' table updated with every insert into 'Enrolled' and then manually remove the balance, this would be better for a web interface though that can activate when the Dues are paid.

Delete anomally on buildings, we need to reassign sections before we delete a building or we lose the sections

Huge issue with days attribute of Sections, assumes only MWF and TTh sections exist
